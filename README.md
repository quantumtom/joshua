This project was ported from my GOES/NOAA realtime satellite weather image animating program. It includes Grunt tasks 
to compile the core JavaScript source using the Google Closure compiler. It also generates JSDoc3 documentation, as 
well as JavaScript sourcemap files to aid in debugging the compiled source code.
